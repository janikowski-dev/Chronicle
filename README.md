**Chronicle** is an Unreal Engine plugin for building narrative-driven games. It gives developers a visual way to create branching dialogues, hook up game logic through a rule system, and eventually manage characters, quests, and cinematic timelines - all from within the editor.

## Modules

Chronicle is divided into separate modules for clarity and easier maintenance. Each module has its own detailed README in the `Docs/` folder.
